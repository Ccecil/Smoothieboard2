##Uploading a board

When uploading a board, you should provide the following data :
* Kicad files
* Kicad components/libraries used in those files
* Gerber files ( unzipped, in a folder called "Gerber" )
* BOM file for the components, based on this model :Â https://is.gd/uxgJPX
* Readme.factory including information on how to produce the board ( if any )
* Readme.use including information on how to use the board. Should include a description of inputs and outputs/how to wire.
* Top and bottom pictures of the PCB, produced using http://gerblook.org/

Please try to use the same naming conventions as other board so there is some kind of unity in the repository.
