Board will take up to 36V input.
A potentiometer at the bottom of each driver circuit will adjust the current output.
Mounting holes for 60mm fan are provided. Place fan underneath so it blows on the side with no components.
The mounting holes for the fan are isolated.
The mounting holes for the board itself are connected to ground.
Three microstep set resistors are provided at the top of each driver circuit. See datasheet for configuration details. To close, either short with solder or use an 0603 jumper.
